    "  - e.g.: Predicts the child's height based on the parent's height.\n",
    "  - Why is it named \"regression\"?:\n",
    "    - The term was first used by Sir Francis Galton, a British statistician and cousin of Charles Darwin, in the late 19th century. Galton was studying the relationship between heights of parents and their children. He observed that although tall parents often had tall children, the children's heights tended to \"regress\" towards the average or mean height of the population. Similarly, children of short parents were often short but their heights still regressed towards the average."
